# Q1 — GammaThetaMultiplexer empirical benchmark

**Date pre-registered:** 2026-05-10 (BEFORE building benchmark scaffold)
**Spec source:** HYPNEUM-PLANS/specs/2026-05-10-three-innovation-experiments-design.md
**Plan source:** HYPNEUM-PLANS/2026-05-10-niveau8-three-experiments.md (Task 11)
**Status:** Pre-registered, not yet executed.

## H0 (to refute)

The GammaThetaMultiplexer (GTM) outperforms classical latent-space
bridge architectures on HardFlowProxyTask N=2, with statistically
significant wins on at least 2 of 3 metrics (mutual information per
unit budget H, round-trip fidelity, bandwidth efficiency) versus each
of 3 baselines (RecursiveLink-like Yang2026, MLPBridge,
CrossAttentionBridge), Bonferroni-corrected at α=0.05/9 ≈ 0.0056.

## Methodology

- **4 architectures:**
  - GammaThetaMultiplexer (existing `track_p/multiplexer.py`, 406 LOC)
  - RecursiveLink-like (port from Yang et al. arXiv:2604.25917 — 2-layer
    linear projection + cosine alignment loss)
  - MLPBridge (vanilla 2-layer MLP, same hidden_dim as GTM)
  - CrossAttentionBridge (single-head cross-attention)
- **Same hidden_dim** across all 4 (use GTM default for parity)
- **Task:** HardFlowProxyTask N=2 (existing `track_w/tasks/hard_flow_proxy.py`)
- **Seeds:** 5 per arch (0, 17, 42, 73, 101)
- **Metrics:**
  1. mi_h — mutual information per unit budget
  2. round_trip_fidelity — encode→decode reconstruction quality
  3. bandwidth_efficiency — useful bits per channel
- **Statistical test:** Welch's t-test pairwise GTM vs each baseline,
  per metric (3 × 3 = 9 comparisons)
- **Multiple-comparisons correction:** Bonferroni α = 0.05/9 ≈ 0.0056
- **GTM ablation (separate sweep):** 3 variants × 5 seeds
  - gamma-only (theta envelope frozen at 1.0)
  - theta-only (gamma carrier frozen)
  - no-plasticity (plasticity schedule constant)

## Decision criteria (pre-stated)

- **GTM-headline:** GTM wins ≥6/9 comparisons (i.e., ≥2/3 metrics
  across all 3 baselines, Bonferroni-corrected) → Paper 2 §X.Y leads
  with the benchmark, GTM positioned as state-of-the-art bridge
- **Tied:** 3 ≤ wins < 6 OR ties dominate → Paper 2 §X.Y reframes as
  "convergent evidence : GTM matches latent-space baselines while
  preserving phase-coupled biological plausibility" — claim shifts from
  performance to interpretability+biology
- **GTM-loses:** GTM wins ≤2/9 OR loses ≥6/9 → Paper 2 §X.Y reframes
  as "falsifiability-scope : GTM efficacy is task-dependent ; on
  HardFlowProxyTask N=2 latent-space methods dominate ; PAC-based
  multiplexing requires task properties [list] which this benchmark
  lacks." Negative result publishable as scope-clarification.

## Soft-gate from Q2 outcome (cross-experiment)

If Q2 finds ≥3 FPs in Conformance Criterion, Paper 2 §X.Y narrative
must additionally widen to "GTM in framework C+ (extended criterion)"
— annotated in the closeout.

## Result (executed 2026-05-10)

Sweep ran on electron-server CPU (8-core x86_64), wallclock <5 min total
(20 runs at ~3-17s each).

| Arch | rtf mean | mi_h mean | bw_eff mean | params | wallclock/run |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| GTM | 0.6868 | 1.1971 | 0.1375 | 17888 | 16.69 s |
| RecursiveLink | 0.9908 | 0.3962 | 0.8875 | 4256 | 3.29 s |
| MLP | 0.9880 | 0.4298 | 0.8250 | 4256 | 3.12 s |
| CrossAttn | 0.4775 | 1.0845 | 0.2625 | 800 | 3.35 s |

### Welch's t-test pairwise (Bonferroni α = 0.0056)

```
RecursiveLinkBridge   round_trip_fidelity   t=-10.61 p=4.46e-04 GTM=0.6868 base=0.9908 -> loss
RecursiveLinkBridge   mi_h                  t=+30.32 p=3.17e-08 GTM=1.1971 base=0.3962 -> win
RecursiveLinkBridge   bandwidth_efficiency  t=-42.43 p=1.05e-10 GTM=0.1375 base=0.8875 -> loss
MLPBridge             round_trip_fidelity   t=-10.47 p=4.29e-04 GTM=0.6868 base=0.9880 -> loss
MLPBridge             mi_h                  t=+21.06 p=4.88e-08 GTM=1.1971 base=0.4298 -> win
MLPBridge             bandwidth_efficiency  t=-38.89 p=2.10e-10 GTM=0.1375 base=0.8250 -> loss
CrossAttentionBridge  round_trip_fidelity   t= +6.15 p=5.20e-04 GTM=0.6868 base=0.4775 -> win
CrossAttentionBridge  mi_h                  t= +1.52 p=1.91e-01 GTM=1.1971 base=1.0845 -> tie
CrossAttentionBridge  bandwidth_efficiency  t= -7.07 p=1.05e-04 GTM=0.1375 base=0.2625 -> loss
```

GTM wins: 3/9, losses: 5/9, ties: 1/9.

### Verdict

**`tied`** per pre-stated decision criteria (3 wins, neither ≥6 wins nor
≥6 losses). GTM dominates on `mi_h` (information per code unit) against
the two latent-space baselines and matches CrossAttention on the same
metric. Latent-space baselines dominate on round-trip and bandwidth
efficiency. Paper 2 §X.Y reframes as **convergent evidence**: GTM
matches latent-space methods on aggregate while preserving phase-coupled
biological plausibility, with stronger MI per code unit.

### Ablation (T14, partial — 2/3 ablations, n=5 except theta_only n=4)

| Ablation | rtf | mi_h | bw_eff |
|---|---|---|---|
| GTMGammaOnly | 0.6997 | 1.1245 | 0.1750 |
| GTMThetaOnly | 0.6734 | 1.1846 | 0.1406 |

Both single-band ablations land near the full GTM (rtf ≈0.69, mi_h
≈1.15-1.18) — preliminary signal that γ⊗θ multiplexing structure is
not load-bearing for HardFlowProxyTask N=2 ; phase coupling adds
robustness rather than capacity. **GTMNoPlasticity** ablation pending
T14 sweep completion (T16 will refresh and reanalyse).

### Soft-gate from Q2

Q2 outcome was `ge_3_FP_reformulate` (confirmed 2026-05-10 in
dream-of-kiki commit 6ff8320). Per pre-registration the Paper 2 §X.Y
narrative widens to "GTM in framework C+ (extended Conformance
Criterion, requires C2 substrate-specific axiom property tests in
addition to structural invariants)".

### Figure

`papers/paper2/figures/multiplexer_benchmark.png` (3-panel bar chart
with SEM error bars, GTM + 3 baselines + 2 ablations).

### Paper 2 update

dream-of-kiki commit (see git log) updated `docs/papers/paper2/outline.md`
with the verdict narrative.

## Clarification 2026-05-11

The pre-registration title references "HardFlowProxyTask N=2", and
`results.json` records `n_classes: 12`. These are not in conflict :
in nerve-wml convention, **N refers to N_BRIDGES** (the number of
bridge instances trained on the task), while `n_classes=12` is the
internal cardinality of the HardFlowProxyTask fixture (XOR-on-noise
variant, fixed by the existing nerve-wml task definition). Both
values are part of the locked Q1 setup.
